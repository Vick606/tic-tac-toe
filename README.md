# Tic Tac Toe: A JavaScript Odyssey

## 🎮 Project Overview

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game, a classic reimagined through the lens of modern JavaScript! This project is part of my JavaScript refresher course, powered by The Odin Project. It's not just about X's and O's; it's a journey through object-oriented programming, module patterns, and DOM manipulation.

## 🌟 Features

- Player Personalization: Enter your names and claim your mark (X or O)!
- Interactive Gameplay: Click to make your move, no keyboard required.
- Smart Move Validation: Try to cheat? Not on our watch! Invalid moves are blocked.
- Dynamic Messaging: Stay informed with real-time game status updates.
- Winning Logic: Complex algorithms (okay, not that complex) detect victories and draws.
- Restart Functionality: Because sometimes, you just need a clean slate.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

- **Module Pattern**: Keeping our code organized and our global namespace clean.
- **Factory Functions**: Creating players with ease and efficiency.
- **Closure and IIFE**: Privacy where we need it, exposure where we want it.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Bringing our game to life in the browser.
- **Event Handling**: Making our game interactive and responsive.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project reinforced several key JavaScript concepts:

1. **Scope and Closure**: Leveraging JavaScript's functional nature.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Structuring code for clarity and reusability.
3. **Module Pattern**: Organizing code into logical, encapsulated units.
4. **Factory Functions**: Creating object instances efficiently.
5. **DOM Manipulation**: Interacting with HTML elements dynamically.
6. **Event Listeners**: Responding to user actions in real-time.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm
- Customizable board sizes (4x4, 5x5)
- Local storage to save game states
- Multiplayer mode over network

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

A big thank you to The Odin Project for providing the blueprint for this JavaScript adventure. Their curriculum continues to challenge and inspire developers around the globe.
